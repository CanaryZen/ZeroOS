                       Advanche ZeroOS
              The Operating System For Everyone.
                              
		             ABOUT:
             Advanche ZeroOS is an Operating System
                Based on the Windows NT Kernel.

             Other Operating Systems like macOS (Darwin)
         Or The Linux Kernel are not supported but can be used
                       for Advanche ZeroOS.

            Advanche ZeroOS checks for the latest updates of the
         Operating System everytime you run it, this can be disabled
                    in the config of Advanche ZeroOS.

             Programs can be used in the following formats of
                         *.zro/*.zero/*.zrx

         If another program goes by *.zro/*.zero but is not in the right format,
                   it will throw a program error at Advanche ZeroOS.

         This is because *.zro/*.zero program files have a certain language that needs
          to be checked inside that program. Since Advanche ZeroOS is coded in Python,
             Advanche ZeroOS uses the Python Language for both *.zro/*.zero files.

          Programs that goes by *.zrx are executables which are more powerful than
         *.zro/*.zero files. This is because that some *.zrx program files have GUIs
                 and some *.zrx program files are Console Programs instead.

       This *.zrx feature can work on the Unsupported System of macOS (Darwin) as well.

           Files Ending With *.zpx/*.zppx/*.zpp are Application Packages for Advanche ZeroOS
                 and can be used to install Applications onto Windows (NT Kernel).

           Python 3.8.0 is required for Advanche ZeroOS. Anything lower or higher than 3.8.0
                          will throw a system error at Advanche ZeroOS.

       Advanche ZeroOS can be updated by the current update command or by enabling the "CheckForUpdates"
              configuration for automatic updates. You can also disable the automatic updates
        configuration to manually install updates, or to keep the current version of Advanche ZeroOS.
      If the current version is not supported by Advanche, you will be required to update Advanche ZeroOS.

     You can also change your Username & Password to be a new password you can remember. Everytime you change
         your username/password, Advanche ZeroOS will automatically restart for changes to be completed.

           Advanche ZeroOS can also be reset to a brand new state. This will automatically wipe the entire configuration
             and will automatically restart for changes to be completed. Also take note that this will not
              reset everything in the current folder, and will not automatically update Advanche ZeroOS.
 
          You can also use Advanche ZeroOS in Offline Mode by enabling the configuration "OfflineMode".
       Please take note that Offline Mode will disable the Updating, Module, and some parts of the Compatability Systems.
          This will also disable some commands from being used due to the "OfflineMode" configuration being enabled.
 
        Advanche ZeroOS also has an Administrator Mode, which you can use to get full access to the system.
            You can also enable Administrator Mode by editing the System Configuration and setting the
                              "AdministratorMode" configuration to True.   
 
        Alongside Advanche ZeroOS's Administrator Mode is the FWC Administrator Mode (Forced Administrator Mode)
           which gives more power over the entire os itself. This is enabled by logging into an admin account
          or by editing the System Configuration and setting the "FWCAdministratorMode" configuration to True.
 
         Advanche ZeroOS also has its own AI Chatbot called "Advanche NonCore" which trains itself overtime as
           you talk to it. This is a Machine-Learning AI Chatbot that is also based off from your Product ID,
            which means if you reset Advanche ZeroOS or enable the "SetupMode" Configuration, it will reset.
 
                There is also a built-in Cloud-Based Anti-Virus that lets you scan files on your computer
                           And will give you the results if the file is found as a virus or not.
                       This is not for Online Files. Since this Cloud-Based Anti-Virus is still in beta,
                            this may be buggy for some users & not all features are available yet.
