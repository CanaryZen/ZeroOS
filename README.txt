#                   Version 1.0.92261.5472
#
#             The Operating System For Everyone.

#
#
#
#            Advanche ZeroOS is an Operating System
#               Based on the Windows NT Kernel.
#
#            Other Operating Systems like macOS (Darwin)
#        Or The Linux Kernel are not supported but can be used
#                      for Advanche ZeroOS.
#
#           Advanche ZeroOS checks for the latest updates of the
#        Operating System everytime you run it, this can be disabled
#                   in the config of Advanche ZeroOS.
#
#            Programs can be used in the following formats of
#                        *.zro/*.zero/*.zrx
#
#        If another program goes by *.zro/*.zero but is not in the right format,
#                  it will throw a program error at Advanche ZeroOS.
#
#        This is because *.zro/*.zero program files have a certain language that needs
#         to be checked inside that program. Since Advanche ZeroOS is coded in Python,
#            Advanche ZeroOS uses the Python Language for both *.zro/*.zero files.
#
#         Programs that goes by *.zrx are executables which are more powerful than
#        *.zro/*.zero files. This is because that some *.zrx program files have GUIs
#                and some *.zrx program files are Console Programs instead.
#
#      This *.zrx feature can work on the Unsupported System of macOS (Darwin) as well.
#
#          Files Ending With *.zpx/*.zppx/*.zpp are Application Packages for Advanche ZeroOS
#                and can be used to install Applications onto Windows (NT Kernel).
#
#          Python 3.8.0 is required for Advanche ZeroOS. Anything lower or higher than 3.8.0
#                         will throw a system error at Advanche ZeroOS.
#
#      Advanche ZeroOS can be updated by the current update command or by enabling the "CheckForUpdates"
#             configuration for automatic updates. You can also disable the automatic updates
#       configuration to manually install updates, or to keep the current version of Advanche ZeroOS.
#     If the current version is not supported by Advanche, you will be required to update Advanche ZeroOS.
#
#    You can also change your Username & Password to be a new password you can remember. Everytime you change
#        your username/password, Advanche ZeroOS will automatically restart for changes to be completed.
